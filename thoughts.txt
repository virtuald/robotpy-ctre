# two pieces to autogenerate:

C++ class wrapping the CCI
pybind wrappers for the C++ class

What is the logger for?

# goal is 100% autogen -- how do I manually fix the things that need to be fixed?

inherit from .. something? Actually, override would need to inherit from autogen

# include extra from template?

# why isn't the template just using CppHeaderParser data directly?
# -> because we need hooks? do we?

# problem: the sim translation is not straightforward

# .. hal needs to be camel cased
# .. actually, just the generated wrapper

# .. ok, how do I translate parameters? maybe a lookup table?
# .. specify it using a hook
